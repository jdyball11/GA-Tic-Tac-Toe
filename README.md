# Wireframes & Approach

Pasted Graphic 1.png

The orginal idea was to have an image of the tic bug and an image of the tic tac lollie appear in lieu of the X and O on the screen with the scores kept on the sides. As I began creating the board I decided to change my angle and go with an AFL theme which fitted the upcoming AFL grand final. I chose to have the 2 teams playing which were Sydney and Geelong and have the team logos with the scores below on the side of the board.

I further decided to break up the game into 4 quarters with a countdown timer visible on the screen. When the timer hit zero, the quarter was finished with a button appearing to progress to next quarter. Players would continue to play through all quarters until the end of the 4th where the player with the highest score won and a winning message appeared with the team who won. Board would restart when button clicked.
